# Objective
The Goal: Monitor and Automate My Apartment  

I aim to monitor the environment in my one-room apartment and eventually automate my existing smart home setup, which includes some lights and a fan. I went for a locally self-hosted solution to increase security and remove limitations of free version of ex. *Adafruit*. This project provided an opportunity to delve into IoT technologies and hands-on DIY projects.

Exploring IoT basics, communications, and home automation has always intrigued me, but I never had the push to start. This course kickstarted my journey, sparking various ideas for future projects. 

*Stay tuned for updates on GitHub!*

## Project insights
This project and course have provided me with new knowledge about IoT concepts and IoT connectivity. But it has also come with some challenges, particularly in server-side setup, but it has been a rewarding experience nonetheless.

# Computer setup

## Programming the Raspberry Pi Pico WH
To develop and run the code on the Raspberry Pi Pico, specifically on a Windows computer (I don't have access to other operating system at this moment) using Visual Studio Code, you will need to:
1. **Download and Install [Node.js LTS](https://Nodejs.org/en/)**
2. **Download and Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)**
3. **Download and Install Pymakr from extensions in VS Code**

![bild](Images/pymakr_install.png)

4. **Flash MicroPython firmware onto Raspberry Pi Pico WH**
- Download the latest MicroPython firmware [here](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w).
- While holding the **BOOTSEL** button, connect your Raspberry Pi Pico WH to the computer. When plugged in, button can be released.
- A new drive should pop-up in file manager called **RPI-RP2**, copy and paste the firmware-file there.
- The device should now automatically disconnect from your computer.
- Replug the USB cable (without holding the BOOTSEL button). And voila!

If you have trouble setting things up or dont know how to start a project, I advice you to check the course's guides for [Installing VS Code and Pymakr](https://hackmd.io/@lnu-iot/rkiTJj8O9) and [Updating firmware of Pi Pico W + Test run code](https://hackmd.io/@lnu-iot/rkFw7gao_#Visual-Studio-Code) and also [Basic code structure](https://hackmd.io/@lnu-iot/B1T1_KM83)  

Great, we are now ready to program our Pi Pico. If you want to experiment with running code, feel free to take a break here.

## Setting up Ubuntu to Run Mosquitto MQTT Server
***Disclaimer:*** I did not have access to a seperate computer and did not want to install Linux as the main operating system so I had to improvise. I knew that Windows 11 could run Linux in a virutal environment with [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). With that knowledge, I set it up on my laptop in a virutal Linux environment because I could not get Mosquitto MQTT to work directly on Windows.

*Side-note: If you want a use simpler solution of Adafruit IO, you can skip this setup part and check out [this tutorial](https://hackmd.io/@lnu-iot/r1yEtcs55) on how to connect to Adafruit*

**Choose your way of setup** [Ubuntu Regular Setup](#ubuntu-regular-mosquitto-setup) or [Ubuntu WSL Setup](#ubuntu-wsl-mosquitto-setup)

### Ubuntu Regular Mosquitto Setup
These steps were taken from a previous student of the course [HERE](https://github.com/Aleij/Smart_Horticulture/blob/main/README.md#ubuntu-server-setup), but are listed below. Thank you, [Aleij](https://github.com/Aleij) (he has a great guide on getting started with GitHub). 

*Note: There are slight variantions in the configuration but choose whichever one you think works best or use trial and error.*

To set up a Ubuntu server for running the Mosquitto MQTT server and Node Red, follow these steps:

1. **Install Ubuntu Server on your old laptop or a dedicated machine.**

   - Download the Ubuntu Server ISO from the official [website](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).
   - Create a bootable USB drive using software like Rufus or BalenaEtcher.
   - Boot your laptop or dedicated machine from the USB drive and follow the installation wizard to install Ubuntu Server.
   - Create an admin user and password.
   - Update the software package.
     ```powershell
     sudo apt update -y
     sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```

2. **Install Mosquitto MQTT broker on the Ubuntu server for communication between devices.**

   - Open PowerShell on your Windows computer.
   - Connect to the Ubuntu server via SSH:
     ```powershell
     ssh ubuntu_server_ip_address
     ```
   - Update the package lists and install Mosquitto and Mosquitto-clients:
     ```shell
     sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
     ```
   - Enable autostart at server boot.
     ```shell
     sudo systemctl enable mosquitto.service
     ```
   - Test Mosquitto configuration:
     Open up two PowerShells and ssh into the server on both.
     In the first one:
     ```shell
     mosquitto_sub -t test/topic
     ```
     In the second one
     ```shell
     mosquitto_pub -t test/topic -m "Hello, MQTT!"
     ```
     If everything is set up correctly, you should see the published message appear in the terminal where you subscribed.

3. **Install Node Red on the Ubuntu server for building the user interface and data flow management.**

   - Install Node.js and npm:
     ```shell
     sudo apt install nodejs npm
     ```
   - Verify the Node.js and npm installations:
     ```shell
     node --version
     npm --version
     ```
   - Install Node-red:
     ```shell
     sudo npm install node-red
     ```
   - Enable autostart at server boot.
     ```shell
     sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
     ```
      
4. **Configure Mosquitto MQTT to communicate with the Raspberry Pi Pico WH, dissable local-only mode.**

   - Locate the mosquitto.conf file. It's usually at /etc/mosquitto/
     ```shell
     sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
     ```
   - Add listener 1883 and allow_anonymous true
    

### Ubuntu WSL Mosquitto Setup
This was my way because of logistical difficulties.

1. **Getting Setup with Ubuntu WSL**
    - Install WSL by following Microsofts [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Then Install Ubuntu from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare).
    - Launch Ubuntu and a Termial window should pop-up, promting you to create an admin user. When successfull, make sure to update the software package.
    ```shell
    $ sudo apt update -y
    $ sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
2. **Installing Mosquitto MQTT Broker**
    - In the Ubuntu termial window type:
    ```shell
    $ sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
    ```
    - Enable autostart at boot.
    ```shell
    $ sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
    ```
    - Check Mosquitto version and support
    ```shell
    $ sudo mosquitto -h
    ```
    - You can start mosquitto with either
    ```shell
    $ sudo systemctl start mosquitto
    "or"
    $ sudo mosquitto
    ```
    We will use the latter one with some flags to specify a config file and run it in verbose mode (basically a debug mode where it prints more information).
    - To do this we will need a configuration file. I had trouble modifiying the default configuration so I created a new one in the conf.d file in the Mosquitto folder.  
    Lets create the file with,
    ```shell
    $ sudo touch /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/custom.conf
    "then type,"
    $ sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/custom.conf
    "to edit the file."
    ```
    - In this file we want to add these lines
    ```shell
    listener 1883
    allow_anonymous true
    # The path to the usernames and passwords file
    password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
    # Give authorization access to specific topic to each user
    acl_file /etc/mosquitto/aclfile
    ```
    - Press ctrl + X, then ctrl + Y and then ENTER to save and exit.
    - Now follow [LNU tutorial](https://hackmd.io/@lnu-iot/rJr_nGyq5) for the rest of the setup since nothing is different.

3. **Install Node-RED**
    - Follow Node-RED's tutorial on how to install it on Windows [HERE](https://Nodered.org/docs/getting-started/windows). (It's short simple steps)
    - Run Node-RED in a *Powershell* terminal window in Windows with ```node-red```

4. **Connect Node-RED to Mosquitto MQTT**  
    When starting Node-RED it should give you the address and port to use for configuration, and since we are running this on one machine we can use ```localhost``` as our address which simplifies things alot (This is not the case later for Pi Pico).
    - The default port if ```1880```, use this to open up Node-RED's configuration page by typing ```localhost:1880``` in to your favorite browsers addressbar.
    - Add an ``"mqtt-in"`` and a ``"Debug"`` node to your flow.
    - Follow [this guide](https://hackmd.io/@lnu-iot/rJr_nGyq5#Connecting-Node-Red-to-Mosquitto-MQTT-Broker) until you've finished step 5.

5. **Now to the fun part of making this work for the Pi Pico**  
    Here is where my struggle was for a long time. Since Mosquitto is running in a virtual environment, it has a virtual ethernet adapter (Ethernet adapter vEthernet (WSL (Hyper-V firewall))). Which is visible if you check ``Ã¬pconfig`` in a command prompt. As can be seen, this IPv4 address is not the same as our local network IPv4 address.
    
    <img src=Images/cmdIPconf.png width=500>
    
    To fix this, we need to link our ip address with a ``portproxy``. [Visual guidance here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCK3easuYm4) from David Bombal on YouTube.
    - Open a terminal/powershell as admin and enter the following command,
    ```powershell
    netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1883 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=1883 connectaddress=172.28.112.X
    ```
    Change ``connectaddress=X.X.X.X`` to your virtual IPv4 address (most likely starting with 172.X.X.X, like mine).
    - Next up, we need to allow trafic through our firewall. So open firewall settings from control panel and go to "Advanced settings" and select "Inbound Rules".
    - Click "New Rule..." on the right hand side, and choose "Port" and hit next.
    - Select "TCP" and enter ``1883`` in "Specific local ports:". Hit next.
    - Select "Allow the connection", hit next and select all (Domain, Private, Public).
    - Hit next and give it a name like ``"WSL 1883"`` so it's easy to remember and find.

# Putting everything together
Wiring everything up should be pretty straight forward. Ground to ground, positive to positive and data or reading pins to one of the available `GPIO` pins on the Microcontroller.

**Be sure to read the datasheet for each component to be sure of what leg or pin goes where**

I had a 10kÎ© resistor from the kit which was ok to use for the photoresistor.
We can calculate the voltage from the photoresistor with a simple voltage divider equation. This is mostly for safety since, and is most likely not needed.
<img src=Images/Voltage_Divider_EQ.png width=200>

$$V_{out} = V_{in} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2},$$

where:
- $( V_{out} )$ is the output voltage,
- $( V_{in} )$ is the input voltage,
- $( R_1 )$ and $( R_2 )$ are the resistances.

##
The final connections should look something like this, try and make it prettier than this :).

<img src=Images/Kopplingar_Visuellt.png>

I missplaced the resistor in this picture, it should be connected to positive rail not ground rail.

Here is my development board and all the little things connected.

# Chosen platform
Describe your choice of platform. If you have tried different platforms it can be good to provide a comparison.

Is your platform based on a local installation or a cloud? Do you plan to use a paid subscription or a free? Describe the different alternatives on going forward if you want to scale your idea.

- Describe platform in terms of functionality
- *Explain and elaborate what made you choose this platform
#

I started the project with my mind set on running everything of my TrueNAS server at my apartmnent. But since it's the summer, I am staying elsewhere and thus I initially went for Adafruit IO as my MQTT broker and visual provider.

While Adafruit was both easy to use and setup I felt that I wanted to challenge myself a little more so I went for a local installation with a future goal to implement this in my home when autumn comes around the corner. I went for the MQTT platform from Mosquitto and Node-RED as my visualization. With this setup I have so much more freedom and customizability with both functionality and looks.

# The code
The code in this project serve the purpose of establishing a connection to Wi-Fi and MQTT Broker, collecting sensor data, and transmitting the data to the MQTT broker. If unsucessful with any connection, it will with MQTT, retry connection, and with Wi-Fi or other error, reset the device after 20 seconds. Every loop the micro controller checks the connection to internet and MQTT broker, sends the data to MQTT server and can also receive instructions, but these are not coded yet.

- `main.py` contains the core functionalities of collecting and sending data to the broker.
- `lib/keys.py` stores the credentials and configurations related to Wi-Fi and MQTT.
- `lib/mqtt.py` provides the implementation of the MQTT client, sending and recieving data.
- `lib/wifiConnection.py` handles the Wi-Fi connection.

`mqtt.py`, `wifiConnection.py`, was taken from the course github [repo](https://github.com/iot-lnu/pico-w/tree/main).

# Data transmission and connectivity
The project uses a locally hosted MQTT broker, but it is possible to make it work over the internet with some further tinkering if wanted.

#
MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices (such as IoT devices) with low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks in mind. It uses a PUBLISH-SUBSCRIBE model.

The minimum packet size of a MQTT message is 2 bytes, which means its substancially smaller than a HTTP packet which is minimum of 26 bytes. This leads to less power consumed.
#

The sensors collected data is transmitted via Wi-Fi to the MQTT Broker using MQTT protocol, described above. I wanted to use MQTT over HTTP because of its lightweight and efficient messaging. To keep power consumption low and reduce overhead.

In this implementation the messages are sent every 10 seconds to reduce unecessary amounts of data being sent. But still keeping it relativly real-time.

Messages recieved by MQTT broker are forwarded to all subsribers like the Node-RED client which recieves the following,
<p align=center>
<img src=Images/node-red-subscriptionPUB.png>
</p>
and then publishes the "ON" or "OFF" (seen last in the picture) message depending on if there is enough light in the room. (This is mostly a debug feature and to easily change later when implementing into Home Assistant.)

## Node-RED Backend
<img src=Images/node-red-flow1.png>

# Data presentation
The visualization of data is done using Node-RED dashboard, which can be easily installed in Node-RED menu.

My representation looks like this:
<img src=Images/node-red-visual.png>

# Finalizing the design
I unfortunatly did not have time or access to my dedicated server, and thus needed to compromise on automation. This has been bumming me out during the whole project but I think I got something to further develop in the coming months. So to summarize, I would not say that the project is not completely finshed yet.

<span style="color: red">TODO:</span> Video presentation.

## Future improvements to be made
These are some of my thoughts to further improve the functionality and behaviour of the project.

- Make the Pico restart code after crash, if say the MQTT broker goes down. (Right now it will crash and stay there)
- Add deep sleep functionality, to save power when not reading or sending data.
- Add some kind of data interval adjustment.
- Improve security
- 3D print case (I have a contact but I am waiting for my turn)
- Make it connect to MQTT broker running in TrueNAS, and automate lights and fan in Home Assitant.
